## 🚀 Features

- **Beautiful UI**: Styled with Bulma, featuring responsive and elegant design.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through user profiles with smooth pagination.
- **Modals**: View detailed user information in centered, rounded, and styled modals.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with friendly messages.
- **Responsive**: Works seamlessly across all devices.

## ✨ How It Works

- **Pagination Logic**: The app shows a limited number of users per page (8 by default). The pagination controls allow you to navigate between different pages of user profiles, with ellipses indicating non-ranged pages for cleaner navigation.
  
- **Modal Details**: Click "View More" on any user card to open a modal that displays the user's avatar, name, role, and additional details.

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Bulma**: CSS framework based on Flexbox for styling.
- **TypeScript**: Typed superset of JavaScript that improves developer experience.
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework.

## 💡 Future Improvements

- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Add a search bar to filter users by name or role.
- [ ] **User Sorting**: Add options to sort users alphabetically or by role.
- [ ] **Advanced Error Handling**: Implement more sophisticated error messages and retry mechanisms.
